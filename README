A couple of small programs and script for synchronizing multiple audio and
video files. 

Here is a typical example workflow:

1.) record video

	-> handycam.mp4 (audio and video)
	-> webcam1.mp4 (video only)
	-> webcam2.mp4 (video only)

	there should be visual markers (use avclapper.html on a handheld
	device) in the video only files. The tones from avclapper.html
	must be audible load and clear on the audio track.

2.) analyze

	avclapper_audio handycam.mp4 | tee handycam.mrk
	avclapper_video webcam2.mp4 | tee webcam2.mrk
	avclapper_video webcam2.mp4 | tee webcam2.mrk

	cat handycam.mrk webcam2.mrk webcam2.mrk | avclapper_analyze

3.) execute the avconv command line suggested by avclapper_analyze

	-> out000.mp4
	-> out001.mp4
	-> out002.mp4
